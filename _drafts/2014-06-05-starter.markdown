## Maptime Starter site

Hosting your own Maptime chapter website? **Starter** is a simple Jekyll theme that's designed to be forked and tweaked to suit your needs. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sitesâ€”and it's the software that will generate your Maptime chapter's site.


### Getting started

* If we've finished onboarding your new chapter into the Maptime organization, then should already have *Starter* cloned into the `gh-pages` branch of your chapter repo and have been given you privileges to push to it.  Please skip ahead and begin to customize your site.  

* Not yet in the Maptime fold?  Fill out [this form](http://maptime.io/start/#start-form) and we'll get you set up!

In either case, once your repository has been cloned in to the Maptime organization, your site will be hosted at `http://maptime.io/<chapter>` where `chapter` is the name of your chapter's repository.


### Customizing your site

Once you have access to your chapter's repository, you're free to customize the site, including its settings. The site's configuration file is [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file, which is a [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file. Here's a rundown of the configuration options:
