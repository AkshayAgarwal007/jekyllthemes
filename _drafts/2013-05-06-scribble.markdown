Scribble
========

A jekyll theme. [Want a demo? click and read instruction. :point_left:](http://scribble.muan.co/2013/05/06/scribble-the-jekyll-theme/)

There is no clever design philosophy to talk about, I tried to find something to work with, and 'scribble' came to my mind. 

This theme uses Open Sans powered by Google Web Fonts, and was written in plain HTML, SCSS & CoffeeScript, though .scss & .coffee files wouldn't be included in the theme. 

The theme is mobile optimised but I did not check browser compatibility. It looks great in Chrome, Safari and Firefox though.
