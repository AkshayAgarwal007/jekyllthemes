This is a generator for the [Shower HTML presentation engine](https://github.com/shower/shower).

It takes your markdown document and transforms it into the Shower slides. Almost all the things are transformed smoothly, however there could be some things you could configure, either in the YAML front matter or using some extra special formatting.

## Install

### At GitHub Pages

Jekyll Shower works at GitHub Pages. Yes, it's using Jekyll and don't need any extra plugins, so using it is really staightforward:

1. [Fork this repo.](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/fork_select)
2. Make any changes to it (like change your username and all those stuff in the `_config.yml`). You can do it right on the GitHub, btw.
3. Commit & Push the changes — GitHub would initialise Pages only on the first push after the forking action. That could take up to 10 minutes.

That's all — after doing so you could go at your generated pages — replace there the `username` with your username: `http://username.github.com/jekyller/`, and you'll see Jekyll-generated example of the Shower presentation.

### Local usage

If you'd like to preview the changes or compile it locally, so you'd have static HTML of your slides (and you could access them without an internet access), you should clone this repo (or a fork) locally:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/shower/jekyller.git
    
Note that you'll need either to use the `--recursive` flag, 'cause there are submodules to fetch, or you'll need to use `git submodule init && git submodule update` in order to fetch them manually if you didn't use this flag.

After cloning all you'll need to do is to run Jekyll in the cloned folder. On how to install and run Jekyll [read it's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#getting-started).

## Use

The basic usage is very simple. After you'll configure everything up in the `_config.yml` (I recommend you do so: you should at least change the default `author` entry), you could begin making your slides.

Look at the `index.md` for an example of how you can describe your slides. Your markdown document should need the YAML front matter like this:

``` YAML
