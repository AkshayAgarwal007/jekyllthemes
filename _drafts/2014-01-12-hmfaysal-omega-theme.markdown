## Basic Setup for new Jekyll site

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and read through [this installation instructions](http://hmfaysal.github.io/hmfaysal-omega-theme/theme-setup/installing-jekyll-on-windows/) if you haven't already.
2. Fork the [HMFAYSAL OMEGA Theme](https://github.com/hmfaysal/hmfaysal-omega-theme/fork)
3. Clone the repo you just forked.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for pulling in large feature images, assigning categories and tags, and other YAML data.
6. Read the documentation below for further customization pointers and documentation.


**Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you don't want on your site.
